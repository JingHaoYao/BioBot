# BioBot
OANDA 2019 Hackathon Project - BioBOT for Slack
BioBOT is a slackbot that takes in user info and a profile picture, and allows other users to query this data if they wish to know more about an individual. 
We hope this bot will allow new hires and current employees to know more about their fellow co-workers.
